# Jumping on the Clouds

[Problem Statement](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/jumping-on-the-clouds/problem)

## Solution

Starting at index 0, if you can jump forwards by 2, do so.
If doing so would land you on a thundercloud, or past the end,
then only jump by 1.  Repeat until you reach the end.

This process can be followed either forwards or backwards.
